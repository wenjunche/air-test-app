# rtmp-proxy

Example for creating Chromium proxy socket for rtmp urls.

To test , run rtmp.py from https://github.com/theintencity/rtmplite.git.

Since a fix for named pipe transport in Runtime 8.0 has not been merged into group-policy branch,  this example assume Runtime is already running on port 9696.
